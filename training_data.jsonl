{"transcript": "Why are people with sciatica switching to the Dainley belt? I've been suffering from sciatica for about two years now. It came on suddenly one day and continued to come and go with my thigh muscle, also contracting by itself, but in the last few months it has got much, much worse, up until the point where it became constant. My doc sent me for two MRIs, and he said that my sciatic nerve had no room to move, as it got pinched because of a herniated disc between the L4 and L5 vertebrae. Since then I've been taking painkillers constantly. I've tried ibuprofen and naproxen, then naphepam, with little to no relief. And then my doc said that the next step would be something stronger, like gabapentin, or even a cortisone injection. I started taking gabapentin, and honestly, it didn't take the pain away completely, but at least it made it bearable. But then I had a four-hour car journey, and it was agony. I couldn't get comfortable in any position, couldn't lie down in the back seat, because my dog takes up a lot of space. I asked myself, is this the life I'm going to live from now on? Unable to walk for as long as I'd like, and now unable to even sit for a couple of hours when I'm traveling. I told myself that from now on, every single day, I'll be searching for a cure, and if I find one, I'll share it with everyone else. I started going to a chiropractor, and mine is actually very good. I'd probably say one of the best in the state. After his appointments, I started feeling better, but after a couple hours, the pain kept roaring back, laughing at my efforts, and it would fully return if I missed an appointment. One appointment would cost me $100, and I needed three per week to get pain relief. Unfortunately, that's too expensive, and my wallet hurts as much as my back does. I had to stop going, continue with those damn pills. Then I noticed that I'm getting addicted to gabapentin, and if I stopped taking it, I'd start having withdrawal symptoms. And that was a big red flag for me. I really needed to find a way to stop the pain and quit taking those pills. So about two months ago, I really took things seriously and started researching everything there is to know about sciatica. I read hundreds of posts on forums dedicated to sciatica and lower back pain. I watched YouTube videos. I joined Facebook groups where people were suffering from sciatica and sharing their experience. I subscribed to health magazines. I started reading articles and meeting with doctors, and even started reading books on this matter. That's how determined I was to find a solution. After weeks of research, I found a case study made by Dr. Steve Brown, a renowned neurologist from Chicago. He explained why sciatica gets so unbearable and how to deal with it, which helped me a lot. The bad news was that I found out that there's really no cure for a herniated disc, and anyone telling you the opposite simply wants to profit from your pain. Yes, you can have surgery, but that's invasive. It costs tens of thousands of dollars, and you get a 50% chance of success. However, there are ways to significantly reduce the pain and not let this condition get worse. Let me explain what I found out, because this is what made a world of difference for me. Working demanding jobs or sitting for prolonged periods of time puts a lot of pressure on your spine as you age. Because of this, your vertebrae compress and start squeezing like those gel-like discs located between them. Those discs are made from a soft gelatinous core on the inside and a thick outer ring on the outside. When a disc gets compressed excessively, the soft inner core breaks through the thick outer ring, and that's what we call a herniated disc. But it's not always painful. It's not the disc itself that's causing you the pain. The pain occurs when the herniated disc pinches your sciatic nerve, and that's what causes the burning pain down your back, buttocks, and legs. That's what happened to me. There is not a single pill, massager, or chiropractor that can repair a herniated disc once the thick outer ring is broken. That's how it remains. The pain coming from sciatica is absolutely debilitating, and if we leave it like that, it only gets worse and worse up to the point where you literally can't move anymore. And unfortunately, I had days exactly like that. Now that after weeks of research, I finally understood why I was hurting, I started looking for ways to reverse the damage and relieve the pain. I tried those inversion tables, but imagine trying to get down from one when your back is spasming and you feel like you're getting cut in half. All I got from it was an expensive headache. I also tried countless products from Amazon that promised the world, and failed to deliver. And to be honest, for a moment I got discouraged that after almost five weeks of research, I didn't find anything that really worked. Then, thank God, about three weeks ago, I found an online forum dedicated specifically to people suffering from lower back pain and sciatica, where literally thousands of people were telling their stories of how they are fighting this terrible pain. I stumbled on a post from four months ago where someone was saying that the only thing that helped him relieve his back pain and sciatica is this device. There were over 3,000 responses to that post, and most of them were from people who tried this weird-looking belt for themselves and said that it was working wonders. It's called the Danely Belt. It was developed by Adam Fischt, one of the best chiropractors in the US, and he said that all you need to do is wear this belt for two hours a day over a period of two to three weeks. It has this patented double compression zone technology, where you basically adjust the level of compression with those elastic white straps. A lot of people were saying that it works, so I decided, hey, what's a few more bucks to all the years I spent hurting? I went to the only place where this belt is available to order, at danelylab.com, and I noticed that they had 60-day results or full refund guarantee. So I basically, if I didn't feel any better after using it, I was going to get my money back anyway. No risk. I got it delivered to my door just about two weeks ago, and here it is. So on the first day, I put it on, not expecting much because I've been let down countless times before. But get this. After about 15 minutes of wearing this belt, my sciatica went from an eight to a two from the first day. Can you imagine? I don't know what magic potion they put in it, and I honestly don't care. What matters for me is that I was finally able to walk, sit, and rest normally for the first time in years. I kept using it every single day for two hours, as the instructions said, and gradually, my pain began to subside more and more each day. Two weeks in, and I'm able to stand for hours with no pain, even when I don't wear the belt. Finally, my legs don't feel like they've been pounded by hammers all day. My lower back feels so much better too. The thing actually did its job. This actually worked. I've read the information from their website, and apparently, this belt offers extra support at the base of my spine, while also boosting the blood flow in the underlying tissue to accelerate the healing process. This helped my back muscle strengthen to decompress my spine and relieve the pressure from my sciatic nerve. I can't tell you how happy I am right now. I probably sound like a broken record to my family, but believe me, once you go through two years of not being able to bend forward to tie your shoelaces, or walk more than ten minutes without feeling like your back is getting drilled into, being pain-free is like you're a whole new person. So please, don't make the same mistake as I did. Don't get stuck on pills for so many years, and don't allow yourself to suffer so horribly from sciatica, lower back pain, and those damned hernias.", "duration": 334.97, "brightness": 131.16, "cuts": 209, "avg_scene_length": 1.6, "market": "UAE", "ran_on": "Ad Acc A", "label": "High"}

{"transcript": "Exercising helps to relieve lower back pain and sciatica, right? No. What about chiropractors? Nope. You've probably seen this guy talking before. Do this to fix your lower back pain and sciatica. He really seems to know what he's talking about. I know it's kind of surprising, but exercising can actually make your lower back pain and sciatica worse. Weird, right? Wait, what? How's that even possible? I know most people think that by exercising you're actually helping your body to relieve lower back pain and sciatica, but actually it's the other way. You see, lower back pain and sciatica are most often caused because of a herniated or a slipped disc that's touching the sciatic nerve. Now you're asking, wait, what's a herniated or slipped disc? Well, years of hard work, prolonged sitting, bad posture can put a lot of damaging pressure on your spine, and that forces your vertebrae to cram closer together. And then between them there are these gel-like discs which act like cushions to prevent excessive strain or movement. Now, when your vertebrae compress, the discs between them move out of place, and then they put pressure on your sciatic nerve. Yeah, so far it's easy to understand. So when you exercise, you're actually just applying more pressure to your already damaged spine. You're basically destroying your sciatic nerve, which causes more pain and can lead to dangerous or expensive surgery. That doesn't sound good. Okay, so what do you do? Well, stop popping ibuprofen, Tylenol, and those addictive opiate painkillers, because those can just make things worse. Painkillers just make you stop feeling the pain. That pain is your body's way of saying, whoa, stop, something's wrong. When you accidentally touch a hot stove, you quickly feel the pain and naturally pull your hand away from it. But what if you didn't feel the pain from touching the hot stove? Doesn't that mean your hand is going to get injured? Well, yeah, you'd probably get a really bad injury because you hold your hand on the stove for longer than you should if you just pulled it away with the pain. That's what painkillers do. They mask the pain that your body is telling you, hey, something's wrong, something is dangerous. Eventually it'll just get worse. Your spine continues to get more and more and more compressed, and your sciatic nerve is getting destroyed day by day, up until the point where surgery really might be the only option. Okay, so what should we do? Chiropractors also aren't the best way to relieve lower back pain and sciatica because you're forced to go two to three times a week, it costs hundreds of dollars a week, and when you stop going, the pain will come back just like it was before. Yeah, I've been there. Just to recap here, we know that painkillers and chiropractors and exercising aren't the best solutions for sciatica and lower back pain. There's got to be an easier, more effective way. Okay, here we go. Well, it's called double compression zone technology, and it was developed by Adam Fisher. He is a chiropractor from New York City. He spent over 10 years researching all there is to know about sciatica. Now, he was one of the first doctors who investigated the link between deep, stabilizing muscles that are in our lower back and then the compressed spine. See, there's something deep in the lower back called the ialisis muscle, and this tiny muscle is the number one cause of sciatica and lower back pain. For such a small muscle, it sure causes a huge number of problems. So you probably didn't know this, but sitting puts more pressure on your spine than standing, and that is where the ialisis muscle gets very tight. The odds are you're actually sitting and destroying your back right now. And the longer you stay seated, the tighter the ialisis muscle gets. Essentially, if you're sitting slouched in an office chair most of the day looking at a screen, one of the problems is you can't decompress your spine without releasing this muscle. But the biggest issue was that after more than a decade of research, Dr. Adams still wasn't able to find a way to release the tight ialisis muscle. He started in his hope, but one day he came across this startup known as Danly. They specialize in developing products that use this patented double compression zone technology. And he read through some of the annotations they had on their website about the technology, and after he was finished reading, he goes, this might be the answer. So soon after that, he teamed up with them. They needed a doctor that would add some medical expertise to their scientific knowledge. They took 13 months, they made 26 prototypes at five different clinical trials, and they invented a solution that actually targets the true root cause of sciatica by mimicking the ialisis muscle while boosting blood flow to the lower back area and decompressing the spine. And that product is called the Danly Belt. And they got an FDA approved at the end of 2022. So the secret in this whole thing is this patented double compression zone technology. You mimic the ialisis muscle and provide stability to the spine while you're sitting, while you're standing, while you're walking. It relieves pressure on the sciatic nerve and that actually provides, get this, instant relief from pain. The Danly Belt also applies targeted medical compression on the hip area, which promotes nutrient rich blood to the massively overstrained ialisis muscle that was causing you the constant stabbing pain and making you feel anxious about every move you took. So when the ialisis muscle gets released, the sciatica pain is gone almost instantly. And that's just going to boost all your energy levels, right? What surprised me the most is that it's not just a quick fix. 93% of users completely eliminated their sciatica in just three weeks. And now they don't even wear the belt.", "duration": 317.53, "brightness": 117.59, "cuts": 154, "avg_scene_length": 2.06, "market": "UAE", "ran_on": "Ad Acc A", "label": "High"}

And when you stop going, the pain comes back because you're not really addressing the root cause of the sciatica. And there are painkillers, which are great at providing short-term relief, but it's only a surface-level treatment. And once the effect wears off, the pain returns. Luckily, a top chiropractor developed a breakthrough solution that's guaranteed to fix your sciatica in 30 days, or your money back. As suppliers to over 49 chiropractic clinics worldwide who, in unison, have treated tens of thousands of patients with our product, we're able to analyze the backs of over 9,547 patients suffering from sciatica. We took that specific information to make adjustments with our in-house chiropractor. 13 months, 26 prototypes, and five clinical trials later, we finally invented a solution that targets the true root cause of sciatica by mimicking the core muscles while boosting the blood flow to the lower back area and decompressing the spine. It's called the Dainley Belt, and we just got it FDA-approved at the end of 2022. The secret is the patented Double Compression Zone technology which applies targeted medical compression on the hip area. So here's the thing. Those core muscles of yours, they're the real heroes. And when they're strained and overworked, they need a little help to get back to their best. That's where the Dainley Belt comes in. It promotes nutrient-rich blood flow to those hard-working muscles, which helps them reactivate and take some of the pressure off your spine. When that happens, your spinal discs decompress, and voila. Say goodbye to sciatica, and hello to pure.", "duration": 174.43, "brightness": 138.48, "cuts": 97, "avg_scene_length": 1.8, "market": "UAE", "ran_on": "Ad Acc A", "label": "High"}
{"transcript": "Why are people with sciatica switching to the Dainley belt? I've been suffering from sciatica for about two years now. It came on suddenly one day and continued to come and go with my thigh muscle, also contracting by itself, but in the last few months it has got much, much worse, up until the point where it became constant. My doc sent me for two MRIs, and he said that my sciatic nerve had no room to move, as it got pinched because of a herniated disc between the L4 and L5 vertebrae. Since then I've been taking painkillers constantly. I've tried ibuprofen and naproxen, then naphepam, with little to no relief. And then my doc said that the next step would be something stronger, like gabapentin, or even a cortisone injection. I started taking gabapentin, and honestly, it didn't take the pain away completely, but at least it made it bearable. But then I had a four-hour car journey, and it was agony. I couldn't get comfortable in any position, couldn't lie down in the back seat, because my dog takes up a lot of space. I asked myself, is this the life I'm going to live from now on? Unable to walk for as long as I'd like, and now unable to even sit for a couple of hours when I'm traveling. I told myself that from now on, every single day, I'll be searching for a cure, and if I find one, I'll share it with everyone else. I started going to a chiropractor, and mine is actually very good. I'd probably say one of the best in the state. After his appointments, I started feeling better, but after a couple hours, the pain kept roaring back, laughing at my efforts, and it would fully return if I missed an appointment. One appointment would cost me $100, and I needed three per week to get pain relief. Unfortunately, that's too expensive, and my wallet hurts as much as my back does. I had to stop going, continue with those damn pills. Then I noticed that I'm getting addicted to gabapentin, and if I stopped taking it, I'd start having withdrawal symptoms. And that was a big red flag for me. I really needed to find a way to stop the pain and quit taking those pills. So about two months ago, I really took things seriously and started researching everything there is to know about sciatica. I read hundreds of posts on forums dedicated to sciatica and lower back pain. I watched YouTube videos. I joined Facebook groups where people were suffering from sciatica and sharing their experience. I subscribed to health magazines. I started reading articles and meeting with doctors, and even started reading books on this matter. That's how determined I was to find a solution. After weeks of research, I found a case study made by Dr. Steve Brown, a renowned neurologist from Chicago. He explained why sciatica gets so unbearable and how to deal with it, which helped me a lot. The bad news was that I found out that there's really no cure for a herniated disc, and anyone telling you the opposite simply wants to profit from your pain. Yes, you can have surgery, but that's invasive. It costs tens of thousands of dollars, and you get a 50% chance of success. However, there are ways to significantly reduce the pain and not let this condition get worse. Let me explain what I found out, because this is what made a world of difference for me. Working demanding jobs or sitting for prolonged periods of time puts a lot of pressure on your spine as you age. Because of this, your vertebrae compress and start squeezing like those gel-like discs located between them. Those discs are made from a soft gelatinous core on the inside and a thick outer ring on the outside. When a disc gets compressed excessively, the soft inner core breaks through the thick outer ring, and that's what we call a herniated disc. But it's not always painful. It's not the disc itself that's causing you the pain. The pain occurs when the herniated disc pinches your sciatic nerve, and that's what causes the burning pain down your back, buttocks, and legs. That's what happened to me. There is not a single pill, massager, or chiropractor that can repair a herniated disc once the thick outer ring is broken. That's how it remains. The pain coming from sciatica is absolutely debilitating, and if we leave it like that, it only gets worse and worse up to the point where you literally can't move anymore. And unfortunately, I had days exactly like that. Now that after weeks of research, I finally understood why I was hurting, I started looking for ways to reverse the damage and relieve the pain. I tried those inversion tables, but imagine trying to get down from one when your back is spasming and you feel like you're getting cut in half. All I got from it was an expensive headache. I also tried countless products from Amazon that promised the world, and failed to deliver. And to be honest, for a moment I got discouraged that after almost five weeks of research, I didn't find anything that really worked. Then, thank God, about three weeks ago, I found an online forum dedicated specifically to people suffering from lower back pain and sciatica, where literally thousands of people were telling their stories of how they are fighting this terrible pain. I stumbled on a post from four months ago where someone was saying that the only thing that helped him relieve his back pain and sciatica is this device. There were over 3,000 responses to that post, and most of them were from people who tried this weird-looking belt for themselves and said that it was working wonders. It's called the Dainley Belt. It was developed by Adam Fischt, one of the best chiropractors in the U.S., and he said that all you need to do is wear this belt for two hours a day over a period of two to three weeks. It has this patented double compression zone technology, where you basically adjust the level of compression with those elastic white straps. A lot of people were saying that it works, so I decided, hey, what's a few more bucks to all the years I spent hurting? I went to the only place where this belt is available to order, at DainleyLab.com, and I noticed that they had 60-day results or full refund guarantee. So I basically, if I didn't feel any better after using it, I was going to get my money back anyway. No risk. I got it delivered to my door just about two weeks ago, and here it is. So on the first day, I put it on, not expecting much because I've been let down countless times before. But get this. After about 15 minutes of wearing this belt, my sciatica went from an eight to a two from the first day. Can you imagine? I don't know what magic potion they put in it, and I honestly don't care. What matters for me is that I was finally able to walk, sit, and rest normally for the first time in years. I kept using it every single day, for two hours, as the instructions said, and gradually, my pain began to subside more and more each day. Two weeks in, and I'm able to stand for hours with no pain, even when I don't wear the belt. Finally, my legs don't feel like they've been pounded by hammers all day. My lower back feels so much better too. The thing actually did its job. This actually worked. I've read the information from their website, and apparently, this belt offers extra support at the base of my spine, while also boosting the blood flow in the underlying tissue to accelerate the healing process. This helped my back muscle strengthen to decompress my spine and relieve the pressure from my sciatic nerve. I can't tell you how happy I am right now. I probably sound like a broken record to my family, but believe me, once you go through two years of not being able to bend forward to tie your shoelaces, or walk more than ten minutes without feeling like your back is getting drilled into, being pain-free is like you're a whole new person. So please, don't make the same mistake as I did. Don't get stuck on pills for so many years, and don't allow yourself to suffer so horribly from sciatica, lower back pain, and those damned hernias.", "duration": 334.97, "brightness": 131.16, "cuts": 209, "avg_scene_length": 1.6, "market": "UAE", "ran_on": "Ad Acc A", "label": "High"}
{"transcript": "Exercising helps to relieve lower back pain and sciatica, right? No. What about chiropractors? Nope. You've probably seen this guy talking before. Do this to fix your lower back pain and sciatica. He really seems to know what he's talking about. I know it's kind of surprising, but exercising can actually make your lower back pain and sciatica worse. Weird, right? Wait, what? How's that even possible? I know most people think that by exercising you're actually helping your body to relieve lower back pain and sciatica, but actually it's the other way. You see, lower back pain and sciatica are most often caused because of a herniated or a slipped disc that's touching the sciatic nerve. Now you're asking, wait, what's a herniated or slipped disc? Well, years of hard work, prolonged sitting, bad posture can put a lot of damaging pressure on your spine, and that forces your vertebrae to cram closer together. And then between them there are these gel-like discs which act like cushions to prevent excessive strain or movement. Now, when your vertebrae compress, the discs between them move out of place, and then they put pressure on your sciatic nerve. Yeah, so far it's easy to understand. So when you exercise, you're actually just applying more pressure to your already damaged spine. You're basically destroying your sciatic nerve, which causes more pain and can lead to dangerous or expensive surgery. That doesn't sound good. Okay, so what do you do? Well, stop popping ibuprofen, Tylenol, and those addictive opiate painkillers, because those can just make things worse. Painkillers just make you stop feeling the pain. That pain is your body's way of saying, whoa, stop, something's wrong. When you accidentally touch a hot stove, you quickly feel the pain and naturally pull your hand away from it. But what if you didn't feel the pain from touching the hot stove? Doesn't that mean your hand is going to get injured? Well, yeah, you'd probably get a really bad injury because you hold your hand on the stove for longer than you should if you just pulled it away with the pain. That's what painkillers do. They mask the pain that your body is telling you, hey, something's wrong, something is dangerous. Eventually it'll just get worse. Your spine continues to get more and more and more compressed, and your sciatic nerve is getting destroyed day by day, up until the point where surgery really might be the only option. Okay, so what should we do? Chiropractors also aren't the best way to relieve lower back pain and sciatica because you're forced to go two to three times a week, it costs hundreds of dollars a week, and when you stop going, the pain will come back just like it was before. Yeah, I've been there. Just to recap here, we know that painkillers and chiropractors and exercising aren't the best solutions for sciatica and lower back pain. There's got to be an easier, more effective way. Okay, here we go. Well, it's called double compression zone technology, and it was developed by Adam Fisher. He is a chiropractor from New York City. He spent over 10 years researching all there is to know about sciatica. Now, he was one of the first doctors who investigated the link between deep, stabilizing muscles that are in our lower back and then the compressed spine. See, there's something deep in the lower back called the ialisis muscle, and this tiny muscle is the number one cause of sciatica and lower back pain. For such a small muscle, it sure causes a huge number of problems. So you probably didn't know this, but sitting puts more pressure on your spine than standing, and that is where the ialisis muscle gets very tight. The odds are you're actually sitting and destroying your back right now. And the longer you stay seated, the tighter the ialisis muscle gets. Essentially, if you're sitting slouched in an office chair most of the day looking at a screen, one of the problems is you can't decompress your spine without releasing this muscle. But the biggest issue was that after more than a decade of research, Dr. Adams still wasn't able to find a way to release the tight ialisis muscle. He started in his hope, but one day he came across this startup known as Danly. They specialize in developing products that use this patented double compression zone technology. And he read through some of the annotations they had on their website about the technology, and after he was finished reading, he goes, this might be the answer. So soon after that, he teamed up with them. They needed a doctor that would add some medical expertise to their scientific knowledge. They took 13 months, they made 26 prototypes at five different clinical trials, and they invented a solution that actually targets the true root cause of sciatica by mimicking the ialisis muscle while boosting blood flow to the lower back area and decompressing the spine. And that product is called the Danly Belt. And they got an FDA approved at the end of 2022. So the secret in this whole thing is this patented double compression zone technology. You mimic the ialisis muscle and provide stability to the spine while you're sitting, while you're standing, while you're walking. It relieves pressure on the sciatic nerve and that actually provides, get this, instant relief from pain. The Danly Belt also applies targeted medical compression on the hip area, which promotes nutrient rich blood to the massively overstrained ialisis muscle that was causing you the constant stabbing pain and making you feel anxious about every move you took. So when the ialisis muscle gets released, the sciatica pain is gone almost instantly. And that's just going to boost all your energy levels, right? What surprised me the most is that it's not just a quick fix. 93% of users completely eliminated their sciatica in just three weeks.

{"transcript": "This is out. We're not doing plastic anymore. I used to cut raw meat and seafood on plastic cutting boards, but not anymore. Every time your knife blade goes into a plastic cutting board, it picks up little bits of plastic that's mixed in with your food and you end up eating it. I was using a plastic board because I didn't want the bacteria from the meat to breathe into the wood because wood is a naturally porous material. When you cut on a wooden board, juices from foods like meats, fruits, and vegetables seep into the board, accumulating toxic bacteria and mold. So if you care about your health and you don't want any toxic plastic materials or nasty bacteria contaminating your food, I recommend checking out this pure titanium cutting board from Tama. Titanium is a naturally resistant material to bacteria and other pathogens, unlike any other materials used in the cutting board industry. It doesn't shed any toxic materials onto your food, meaning that your food always stays pure without any harmful toxins. Also, titanium lasts a lifetime and is low maintenance compared to wood or plastic. It can be easily cleaned with soap or water and is dishwasher safe. Surprisingly, it's also gentle on your knives. Even though titanium is a strong material, it's actually softer than the steel used in most kitchen knives, which helps maintain the knife's sharpness and keeps them sharp longer. Bottom line, ditch the old school boards if you are someone who cares about their health and food quality. Click shop now and get your Tama titanium board today.

{"transcript": "these boards are the reason why you are sick. A study just published last year showed that if you are using a plastic cutting board, you can be ingesting anywhere up to 50 grams of microplastic per year. So that's about 12 credit cards worth of plastic. Alternative for the plastic cutting boards, what should we be using? Studies have shown that wooden cutting board is actually more dangerous because every time you chop, you create tiny grooves where toxic bacteria from food particles and mold hides. And no matter how much you scrub, you will never wash them away because the wood absorbs it. Over time, this hidden mold and bacteria like Salmonella or E. coli transfers from your board to your food and slowly makes you and your family ill. From allergies and serious chronic inflammation to gut issues like diarrhea and bloating. That's why restaurant and private chefs are switching to Nexel titanium cutting board and you should too. Crafted in Japan with health and lifetime durability in mind. Nexel, a 100% pure medical grade titanium board has a non-porous surface that bacteria and mold can't penetrate. All because titanium is naturally antibacterial unlike any other type of cutting board. Plus it doesn't leave food stains and is super easy to clean. Everything just washes off right away.

{"transcript": "Disgusting, you don't ever cut on a plastic board. I used to cut raw meat and seafood on a plastic cutting board, but not anymore. Every time your knife blade goes into the board, it's picking up little bits of plastic, and that plastic gets mixed in with your food, and you end up eating it without knowing it. The reason I was using the plastic cutting board is I didn't want the bacteria from the meat to breed into the wood, because wood is a naturally porous material. When you cut on a wooden board, juices from foods like meats, fruits, and vegetables seep into the board. Plus, every cut on a wooden board creates tiny grooves that further help to hide toxic bacteria and mold. So if you care about your health and don't want any toxic plastic materials or nasty bacteria contaminating your food, I recommend checking out this pure titanium cutting board from Tyma. Titanium is naturally resistant to bacteria and other pathogens, unlike any other material used in cutting boards, and it doesn't shed toxic materials onto your food, meaning that your food always stays pure without any harmful contaminants. Also, titanium lasts a lifetime and is low maintenance compared to wood, which requires regular oiling to prevent cracking and warping, or plastic, which can warp or melt when exposed to high temperatures. Tyma can be easily cleaned with soap and water and is dishwasher safe. Surprisingly, it's also gentle on your knives. Even though titanium is a strong material, it's actually softer than steel used in most kitchen knives, helping to maintain the knife's sharpness for longer compared to some other hard materials. Bottom line, ditch the old school boards if you care about your health and food quality.

{"transcript": "titanium cutting board a good gift? Meet Taima. It's designed with health and sustainability in mind. Not a lot of people know it, but titanium has exceptional antibacterial properties, so unlike wooden cutting boards, it doesn't harbor bacteria, liquids, or mold, giving you a sterile smooth surface to slice on. Plastic boards are probably the worst ones that you can use. They shed tons of microplastics onto your food for every use, which can disrupt your hormones, cause inflammation, and tons of other health issues. Taima doesn't shed any toxic materials onto your food, plus I feel safe cutting on it since I know that titanium is extremely biocompatible and is even used for medical implants. I hate cleanups after every meal prep. Plastic and wooden boards constantly leave food stains that are impossible to clean. Thankfully, titanium is a breeze to clean. Rinsing it under the sink is usually enough, but if I feel extra lazy, I just throw it into the dishwasher. Overall, I love having a cutting board that allows me to feel healthy and is easy to maintain on a daily basis. If you want to get one for yourself, click shop now below and see if they're still available.", "duration": 57.5, "brightness": 121.48, "cuts": 44, "avg_scene_length": 1.31, "market": "UAE", "ran_on": "Ad Acc A", "label": "High"}
